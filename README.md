ðŸ›  Tools Used

Microsoft Excel

ðŸ”¹ Steps Performed

1. Handled Missing Values
Replaced blank values in Country with "Unknown".
Kept blanks in Director and Cast since they occur frequently.
2. Removed Duplicates
Used Excelâ€™s Remove Duplicates feature on Title + Type + Release Year.
3. Standardized Text
Fixed Type column values to ensure only Movie and TV Show exist.
Applied consistent capitalization where needed.
4. Date Cleaning
Attempted to convert Date Added into a consistent format.
Noted that Excel stored dates as text in some cases, so I kept the original format (Month Day, Year) for accuracy.
5. Renamed Columns
Cleaned headers for consistency (lowercase, underscores instead of spaces).
6. Checked Data Types
Ensured release_year is numeric.
Confirmed date_added is a valid date column.
